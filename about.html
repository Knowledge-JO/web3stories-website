                With every NFT created, every blockchain program deployed, every piece of hardware added to a decentralized network, Web 3 participants are changing the way internet works, to create a fairer distribution of wealth and social influence for humanity.
    
                Web3Stories.net is an NFT project that takes a snapshot of experiences in the Web 3 movement, written by individuals who are active in the space, celebrating the birth of the decentralized internet. Their experiences are combined with images, depicting emotions and vibes associated with adventures on advanced technological frontiers, to form a unique collection of NFTs. From screenshots of programming languages to personal experiences, to famous quotes, this collection strives to evolve in the direction of being as eclectic as the Internet itself.
    
                Eventually, this collection will be used to assemble the Web 3 Monument in cyberspace.
