                <h2 class="title">1. Create the Web3Stories.net collection, with a FREE NFT MINT.</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    Individuals active in the Web 3 space, such as developers, investors, and enthusiasts, will be invited to submit brief statements or images, related to their Web 3 experience, which will be used as the basis for creating NFTs in the collection. This may be as simple as mentioning the type of work that the contributor has done to help build Web 3, or a famous quote relevant to the vibe of the Web 3 movement, or it can have greater detail (the text should fit within the frame used to enclose individual NFTs, please see the collection to get an idea of how much text to submit).

                    For those who are accepted, a free NFT will be sent to the wallet address provided (see TERMS in the SUBMIT YOUR STORY page of this website). Some actions on Twitter and Discord are required, but we know that people active in the Web 3 space have better things to do than spend 12 hours a day on social media, trying to get white list spots, so we have kept the requirements to a minimum. Contributors are eligible for a free NFT (provided the terms of this website and project are met), without needing to mint it themselves, and without gas fees. NFT holders who have contributed to the collection will form a community, with opportunities to network in meet-ups and on social media. The NFTs also have added utilities, such as airdrops and access to special games and events.

                    Every normal an reasonable effort will be made to ensure that a valid contributor receives a free NFT.

                    The collection will be deployed across multiple chains, to further increase the level of decentralization.

                <div class="content">
                    The NFTs in the collection will be assembled to construct the Web 3 Monument, commemorating the birth of Web 3. The construction of this monument will take place in the decentralized metaverse, for which venues have already be reserved, in the Sandbox and elsewhere.
